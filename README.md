Various small examples from my Rust course. Previously a lot
of these were on the playground, but I prefer to have them
in a controlled repository now.

* `datatypes`: examples of various datatype thingies
* `structs.rs`: struct and enum examples
* `arrays.rs`: array and vector examples
* `strings.rs`: string and str examples
* `iterators.rs`: iterator examples
* `closures.rs`: closure examples
* `lifetimes.rs`: simple lifetime example
* `rc`: examples with `RefCell` and `Rc`
